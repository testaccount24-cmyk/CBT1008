        Finalising The Installation of the ISPPREP Modification
        -------------------------------------------------------

Once you have RECEIVEd the 3 datasets that comprise the ISPPREP
modification there are some steps that need to be taken in order to
complete the installation.

These steps depend on the individual site requirements and/or policies
as to how to proceed.

The steps required are:

1) Backup the Target Libraries (optional but recommened)
   ---------------------------

   Before making any changes it is recommended that you take backups.
   If you don't want to backup the full library then you could just back
   up the two members that get changed (ISPPREPA panel, and the ISPPREP
   load module).

2) Decide how to Implement the Modifications (Required)
   -----------------------------------------

   The sample jobs provided offer different methods for performing
   the modifications.

         a) Using SMP/E USERMODS.
   or    b) Using SUPERZAP and IEBCOPY to zap your existing ISPPREP
            and IEBCOPY to copy the ISPPREPA panel to your own library.
   or    c) Simply concatenate the LOADLIB and ISPPLIB libraries ahead
            of your production libraries.

3) Using SMP/E (Optional)
   -----------

    If you chose to install the modifications using SMP/E the sample
    jobs in the JCL library are provided but they will need to be
    tailored for your site.

         a) Change the SMPEPROC member to point to your SMP/E CSI.
         b) Change the SMPEJCL to point to point to your GLOBAL and
            TARGET zone names.
         c) Change the SMPEJCL member JCLLIB card to point to library
            containing the SMPEPROC procedure.
         d) Change the SMPEJCL member so that the PTFDSN points to the
            library contain the USERMODs ASL0001 and ASL0002.
         e) Change the ASL0002 member to point the INDD statement to
            the library containing the ISPPREPA panel distributed with
            this modification.
         f) Change the ASL0002 member to point the OUTDD statement to
            the target library for the ISPPREPA panel.
         g) Modify the JOBCARD in SMPEJCL to meet your site standards.
         h) Submit the SMPEJCL job.

4) AMASPZAP & IEBCOPY Install (Optional)
   --------------------------

    If you chose to install the modifications using the SUPERZAP and
    IEBCOPY method you will need to tailor the jobs to meet your site
    standards.

         a) Change the ZAP member in the JCL library to point to your
            target load module library. If you want to change our
            default names from ZPREPIN & ZPREPOUT this is where you
            would do that. If you do change the names you will have to
            perform a global change in the ISPPREPA panel to reflect
            those changes.
         b) Change the IEBCOPY member in the JCL library to point to
            your target panel library.
         c) Modify the JOBCARDS in the ZAP and IEBCOPY members to adhere
            to your site standards
         h) Submit the ZAP and IEBCOPY jobs.

5) Just using IEBCOPY (Optional)
   ------------------

    If you chose to install the modifications using just IEBCOPY then
    the supplied member IEBCOPY2 will copy the required members from
    the distributed panel and load libraries into your chosen libraries.

    The IEBCOPY2 job will need to be tailored to meet your site
    standards.

         a) Change the IEBCOPY2 to point to your target panel and load
            libraries. The OUTPANL should be the panel library to be
            used. OUTLOAD is for the load module
         b) Change the IEBCOPY2 to point to the distribution libraries
            created by the UNPACK process. INPANEL should point to be
            distributed panel library and INLOAD to the distributed
            load library.
         c) Modify the JOBCARD in the IEBCOPY2 member to adhere to your
            site standards
         h) Submit IEBCOPY2 job.

6) Refresh LLA (May be required)
   -----------

    Depending on where the ISPPREP module is located at your site you
    may need to refresh LLA in order to pickup the changes.

    That concludes the modification installation.
